Hi, My name is **Liwei Deng**, a senior undergraduate student from [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/), majoring in [Electronic Information Engineering](https://ceie.szu.edu.cn/) (expected graduation in July 2025). I will join [UTS@AAII](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/australian-artificial-intelligence-institute) (University of Technology Sydney, Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute) as a PhD. Student in July 2025, supervised by Prof. [Guodong Long](https://guodonglong.github.io/).

My research interest includes **Time Series Forecasting** and **Federated Recommendation**.
